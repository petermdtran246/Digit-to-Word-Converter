# Digit to Word Converter

This project offers a Python program that converts a single-digit integer (0-9) to its corresponding written word.

## Algorithm:

1. Function Definition:

The program defines a function named DigitToWord that takes an integer d as input.

2. Conditional Statements:

  -  The DigitToWord function uses a series of if-elif statements to check for specific digit values (0 to 9).
  -  If a match is found, the corresponding written word ("one", "two", etc.) is printed using print.

3. User Input and Function Call:
In the main block of the code:
  -  An integer variable d is declared to store the user-provided digit.
  -  The program prompts the user to enter a single digit (0-9) using input.
  -  The user's input is converted to an integer using int and stored in the d variable.
  -  The DigitToWord function is called with the d value as an argument. This triggers the conversion logic based on the entered number.
